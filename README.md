# SwiftBuy Image Recommender System

### SwiftBuy is an image-based recommendation system that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to suggest similar images to a user-uploaded image. This project leverages the ResNet50 model and Nearest Neighbors algorithm to provide accurate image recommendations.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in `png`, `jpg`, or `jpeg` formats.
- **Feature Extraction**: The system uses the ResNet50 model to extract features from the uploaded image.
- **Image Recommendation**: The system recommends similar images based on the extracted features using a nearest neighbor approach.
- **Interactive Interface**: The application is built using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying recommendations.
